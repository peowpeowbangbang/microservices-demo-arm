##### Microservices Demo by Google

I've tested this deployment files using microk8s in MacOS. The commands below contains the microk8s command, which you can omit if you've properly installed and configure your *kubectl* command.

###### Pre-requisite:
* microk8s installed and running
* microk8s add-ons installed and enabled
- dashboard
- dns
- helm
- helm3
- host-access
- host path-storage
- ingress
- metric-server
- storage 


* Your hosts file should contain similar entry below. This will vary what your microk8s IP receives from the bootp. To obtain the IP address, go to the multipass icon tool bar then click the open-shell. Once you are in the shell, run ```ip a``` or ```ifconfig``` command. 


```
